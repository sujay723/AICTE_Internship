Water Quality Prediction - RMS
This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor. It was developed as part of a one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.

# Overview
Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:

1.Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
2.Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression
3.Built a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor
4.Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics

# Technologies Used
1.Python 3.12
2.Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
3.Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation
4.Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
5.Jupyter Notebook – Interactive experimentation

# Predicted Water Quality Parameters
The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:
1.NH4
2.BOD5 (BSK5)
3.Colloids
4.O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4 and
5.CL
# Model Performance
The model was evaluated using:
1.R² Score
2.Mean Squared Error (MSE)
3.Performance was acceptable across all parameters
